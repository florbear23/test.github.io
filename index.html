                            <h3>Why Documenting Your Code Is So Important</h3>
                                <p>Hopefully, if you’re reading this tutorial, you already know the importance of documenting your code.
                                   But if not, then let me quote something Guido mentioned to me at a recent PyCon:</p>
                                <p>When you write code, you write it for two primary audiences: your users and your developers (including yourself). Both audiences are equally important. If you’re like me, you’ve probably opened up old codebases and wondered to yourself, “What in the world was I thinking?” If you’re having a problem reading your own code, imagine what your users or other developers are experiencing when they’re 
                                    trying to use or contribute to your code.</p>
                                <Code>def hello_world():
                                    # A simple comment preceding a simple print statement
                                    print("Hello World")</Code>

                            <h3>Commenting vs Documenting Code</h3>
                                <p>Comments are created in Python using the pound sign (#) and should be brief statements no longer than a few sentences. Here’s a simple example:</p>

                                              is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
